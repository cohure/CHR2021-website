In the arts and humanities, the use of computational, statistical, and mathematical
approaches has considerably increased in recent years. This research is characterized by
the use of formal methods and the construction of explicit, computational models. This
includes quantitative, statistical approaches, but also more generally computational
methods for processing and analyzing data, as well as theoretical reflections on these
approaches. Despite the undeniable growth of this research area, many scholars still
struggle to find suitable research-oriented venues to present and publish computational
work that does not lose sight of traditional modes of inquiry in the arts and humanities.
This is the scholarly niche that the CHR conference aims to fill. More
precisely, the conference aims at

1. Building a community of scholars working on humanities research questions relying on a
   wide range of computational and quantitative approaches to humanities data in all its
   forms. We consider this community to be complementary to the digital humanities
   landscape. 
   
2. Promoting good practices through sharing “research stories”. Such good practices may
   include, for instance, the publication of code and data in order to support
   transparency and replication of studies; pre-registering research design to present
   theoretical justification, hypotheses, and proposed statistical analysis; or a redesign
   of the reviewing process for interdisciplinary studies that rely on computational
   approaches to answer questions relevant to the humanities. 



### Topics of interest

We invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including -- but not
limited to -- the following:

- Applications of statistical methods (machine learning) to process, enrich and analyse
  humanities and cultural heritage data; 
- Hypothesis-driven humanities research;
- Development of empirical methods for humanities research;
- Modeling bias, uncertainty, and conflicting interpretation in the humanities; 
- Evaluation methods and development of standards;
- Statistical evaluation of categorization / periodization;
- Explanatory models for humanities research;
- Theories for quantitative methods and computational humanities approaches;
- Translation and transfer of methods from other disciplines, approaches to bridge
  humanistic and statistical interpretations.

proceedings](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2723/).

### Submission types

**Long Papers**: up to 6000 words (ca. 12 pages, references, abstract and
   tables/illustrations excluded), long papers report on completed, original and
   unpublished results. Brevity of argument is preferred. We welcome the use of appendices
   or other supplementary information.

**Short Papers**: up to 3000 words (ca. 6 pages references, abstract and
   tables/illustrations excluded), small papers report on focussed contributions, and may
   present work in progress, negative results, and opinion pieces.

Overleaf has a word count functionality, or you can use the
[TexCount](https://app.uio.no/ifi/texcount/) application.



### Submission instructions and review process
Submissions should be written in English and must be formatted according to the [CHR latex template](https://github.com/cohure/CHR-2021/raw/main/chr2021_latex_template.zip) 
(see instructions on the forum to get you started [here](https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org/t/chr-latex-instructions/230)).

Submissions are to be submitted anonymously. All papers will be refereed through a 
double-blind peer review process by at least three reviewers with final acceptance
decisions made by the conference organizers. The anonymity period runs until the notification of acceptance (no preprint publication before this date).

Paper should be submitted as PDF documents via the Easychair conference management
system: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chr2021. 

At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the conference and present
the paper.

Accepted papers will be submitted for publication to published online via the
[CEUR-WS](http://ceur-ws.org/) Proceedings publication service.

Authors are encouraged to openly share code and data. If the authors have created an
openly available dataset associated with the research presented in the CHR2021 paper, in
addition to the conference paper, they are welcome to submit a data paper describing their
dataset in the [Special Collection on Computational Humanities Data](https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org/t/cfp-computational-humanities-research-data-journal-of-open-humanities-data/706) of the [Journal of OpenHumanities Data](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/), which accepts submissions on a
rolling basis.
